# Federated Subscriptions Workshop Summit 2024: Starter code

Hello and welcome! This is the starter code for the Summit 2024 workshop, **Realtime data across your graph with federated subscriptions**. We're happy you're here!

Inside of this repo you'll find three directories:

- `router`
- `messages`
- `accounts`

Each of these directories contains its own `README.md` file to get you up and running.

## Prerequisites

To run this repository, you'll need Node and a terminal. As part of the workshop prereqs, you should already have [Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/) downloaded, along with the Router binary. (You'll also have created a graph in Studio, and published this and the other subgraph schemas!)

# (Odyssey Course) Federated Subscriptions with TypeScript & Apollo Server

Welcome to the starter code for **Federated Subscriptions with TypeScript & Apollo Server**. You can find the [course lessons and instructions](https://apollographql.com/tutorials/federated-subscriptions-typescript) on Odyssey, [Apollo](https://apollographql.com)'s learning platform.

Inside of this repo you'll find three directories:

- `router`
- `messages`
- `accounts`

Each of these directories contains its own `README.md` file to get you up and running.

## Prerequisites

To run this repository, you'll need Node and a terminal. You should already have [Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/) downloaded. We'll walk through setting up a graph in Studio, which will give you the specific graph credentials you'll need to develop locally and ultimately publish your subgraph schemas.
